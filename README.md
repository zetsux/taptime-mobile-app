# taptime-mobile-app

## Description

TapTime! is a mobile application created using Flutter (Dart) as my 1st assignment for Mobile-based Programming in College to utilize widgets, states, and lists in an app implementation. It's a reflex test app that time your reflex in milliseconds and store your history that's editable and deletable (supports CRUD) with a high score mechanism.

I created the app from scratch with the help of StackOverflow to explain about widgets or solve tricky bugs, such as the needs of different and custom SetState function to refresh the data in ModalBottomSheet. I also utilized ChatGPT to help the development process by giving me the utilization methods of several widgets that I'm unfamiliar with such as GestureDetector or how to interact with data that's stored locally in SharedPreferences.
